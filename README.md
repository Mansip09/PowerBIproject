Data visualization is about analyzing data and extracting valuable insights. Power BI is a powerful tool for data visualization. It allows businesses to quickly and easily visualize large datasets, gain insights into their data, and make data-driven decisions. It is used to create interactive, visually appealing charts, graphs, and reports that can tell a story and uncover hidden trends.
With Power BI, you can connect to files, online sources, relational/no-SQL databases, Azure Analysis Services, and transform and model data using Power Query and DAX measures. It is even possible to share Power BI reports/dashboards using Power BI Service.
